## Virtual Environments

### What is a Virtual Environment?

A virtual environment is an **isolated Python installation** for a specific project. It has its own set of packages completely separate from other projects and your system Python.

Think of it as a dedicated workspace where you can install any packages without affecting anything else on your computer.

### Why Virtual Environments Matter for GenAI

GenAI projects often have complex dependencies:
- `transformers` version 4.35 might need `torch` 2.0
- Another project might need `torch` 1.13
- Some packages conflict with each other

Without virtual environments, you'd constantly break one project while working on another.

| Scenario | Without venv | With venv |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Project A needs torch 1.13 | Global install | Isolated in Project A's venv |
| Project B needs torch 2.0 | Overwrites 1.13, breaks A | Isolated in Project B's venv |
| Update breaks something | Affects all projects | Only affects one project |

---

## Creating and Using Virtual Environments

### Step 1: Create

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

| Part | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `python` | Your Python interpreter |
| `-m venv` | Run the built-in venv module |
| `venv` | Name of the folder to create (convention) |

This creates a `venv/` folder containing:
- A copy of the Python interpreter
- A fresh `pip` installation
- Empty `site-packages` directory

### Step 2: Activate

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

When activated, your prompt changes:
```bash
(venv) ~/project $
```

### Step 3: Work

While activated:
- `pip install` packages go into this environment only
- `python` runs this environment's interpreter
- System Python remains untouched

### Step 4: Deactivate

```bash
deactivate
```

Returns to your normal shell.

## pip: Python's Package Manager

### What is pip?

`pip` installs packages from the **Python Package Index (PyPI)**, a repository of over 400,000 Python packages.

### Basic Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pip install package` | Install a package |
| `pip install package==1.2.3` | Install specific version |
| `pip uninstall package` | Remove a package |
| `pip list` | Show installed packages |
| `pip show package` | Show package details |
| `pip install --upgrade package` | Upgrade to latest |

### Dependencies

When you install a package, pip automatically installs its dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

This might install 20+ packages that `transformers` needs (torch, tokenizers, huggingface_hub, etc.).

---

## Requirements Files

### Why Requirements Files?

When sharing a project, others need to install the same packages. A `requirements.txt` file lists exactly what's needed.

### Creating requirements.txt

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This outputs all installed packages with exact versions:
```
torch==2.0.1
transformers==4.35.0
numpy==1.24.3
...
```

### Installing from requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### The Complete Workflow

**Developer A (creating the project):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install transformers torch
# ... develop the project ...
pip freeze > requirements.txt
git add requirements.txt
```

**Developer B (cloning and running):**
```bash
git clone project-repo
cd project-repo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Ready to work!
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use virtual environments** for GenAI projects
2. **Name it `venv`** (convention, and often in `.gitignore`)
3. **Never commit the venv folder** (add to `.gitignore`)
4. **Commit requirements.txt** so others can recreate the environment
5. **Update requirements.txt** when adding new packages

```bash
# .gitignore
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```
